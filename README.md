# vitb-semwise-codes
This repository contains my semester-wise classroom codes (from VIT Bhopal). Many of these were written under time constraints and may not be fully optimized or produce the desired output. They reflect my learning journey, including both successes and mistakes, and are preserved here as part of my academic growth. Author : Lakshya Kant
